# Weather-app
This is a weather application project created using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a weather API. The aim of this project is to provide users with real-time weather information for a given location.

Skills Used
The following skills were utilized in the development of this project:

1.HTML: HTML was used to structure the web page and define the various elements such as headings, buttons, and input fields. It provides the foundation of the user interface.
2.JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity to web pages. In this project, JavaScript is responsible for fetching data from the weather API, processing the response, and dynamically updating the weather information on the page.
3.CSS: CSS was used to style the web page, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. It helps in creating an appealing and user-friendly interface.
4.Weather API: The project utilizes a weather API to retrieve real-time weather data. The API allows the application to make HTTP requests and receive weather information in a structured format, typically in JSON.

How the App Works
1.The user opens the weather application in their web browser.
2.The web page presents a simple and intuitive interface, displaying an input field to enter the desired location and a search icon button.
3.The user enters the location they want to get weather information for, such as a city or a specific geographic coordinate.
4.Upon clicking the search icon button, JavaScript is triggered and sends a request to the weather API, including the entered location as a parameter.
5.The weather API processes the request and returns weather data in JSON format.
6.JavaScript receives the weather data and extracts the relevant information, such as the temperature, humidity, and weather condition.
7.The JavaScript code dynamically updates the web page, displaying the retrieved weather information to the user.
8.The user can repeat the process by entering a different location and clicking the search icon button again.

Running the Project Locally
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2.Open the project directory and navigate to the index.html file.
3.Double-click the index.html file to open it in your default web browser.
4.The weather application will now be accessible, and you can start entering locations to retrieve weather information.

Conclusion
This weather app project demonstrates the use of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a weather API to create a web application that provides real-time weather information. By combining these skills, the project delivers a user-friendly interface and fetches data from an external API to enhance its functionality. Feel free to explore the code and further customize the app to suit your needs.
